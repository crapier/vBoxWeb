vBoxWeb
=======
Web Application front end for Texas A&M CSCE 483 Senior Design Project. 

This project was desgined as an ODB/GPS/Camera monitor for a car. It uses a microcontroller to read and record data from a bluetooth ODB device, a USB camera, and a USB GPS device.  

This simple web application can read log files and images created by the microcontroller or iOS app and displays the data interactively over a map as well as in graphs.
